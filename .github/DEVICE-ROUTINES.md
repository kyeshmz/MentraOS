# Device routine integration

The private [Mentra-Automated-Testing repository](https://github.com/Mentra-Community/Mentra-Automated-Testing)
owns English routines, deterministic replay, device drivers, recording,
fixture setup/recovery and the device worker queue. Its
[initial PR](https://github.com/Mentra-Community/Mentra-Automated-Testing/pull/1)
preserves the imported source and license. MentraOS contains no executable copy
of that harness; `tools/mentra-e2e/README.md` is a migration pointer.

MentraOS retains:

- App compilation, signing and published artifacts, including the company Mac installer.
- The public build receipt and Core result/claim contracts.
- Request generation, the callback to the private queue, and build links in Slack.
- Authenticated Core result/claim APIs, private evidence storage and the admin viewer.

## Request and dispatch

1. Add `routine:no-glasses`, `routine:no-glasses-android`, `routine:day1-ota` or `routine:mentra-call` to a
   same-repository PR targeting `dev` or `staging`. Multiple labels request separate
   routines. A staging-targeted PR app is built against staging services, and its
   request binds the current staging tip and that backend; the request itself still
   runs from the trusted `dev` workflow.
2. The [request workflow](workflows/request-e2e-routine.yml) records the current
   PR revisions, exact successful platform build/publication attempt, receipt, Mac
   archive or Android APK and OTA manifest in an immutable `request.json` artifact. If these
   are unavailable it records `no-artifact`; no device test has run.
3. Once app publication succeeds, the trusted default-branch
   [dispatch callback](workflows/dispatch-device-routine.yml) validates the
   current PR/label and asks the request workflow on `dev` to select that exact
   source build and publication attempt. The callback for a completed ready
   request revalidates its identity and dispatches its request run/attempt to
   the private workflow on `main`. Bootstrap PR-event requests are excluded
   from automatic dispatch.
4. The private worker independently validates that request, its enrollment,
   selected artifacts and fixture, then reserves execution through the Core
   shared claim API before entering the routine. Duplicate/ambiguous ownership
   does not start another hardware execution.

The callback passes repository, immutable run/attempt identifiers and the
authenticated routine ID. It does
not send shell commands, executable paths or fixture overrides from public PRs.
The trusted callback mints a short-lived GitHub App token with Actions write
access only to the private repository, without checking out PR code. Both
repositories configure `TEST_RUN_GITHUB_APP_ID` and
`TEST_RUN_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`. The private worker mints a separate
source-read token and retains independent claim and evidence-upload capabilities.

The callbacks must reach the repository's default branch and have their scoped
credentials configured before they run. Private workflow activation, host/app
permissions, artifact preparation and fixture qualification are separate gates.
A registered runner or an accepted dispatch is not a completed test. Successful
coordinated dev/staging builds request the no-glasses walkthrough automatically.
The optional [nightly scheduler](workflows/nightly-device-routines.yml) requests
day-one OTA, Mentra Call and the two combined Mac/Android suites. Missing combined
worker registrations stay unavailable; see its [activation runbook](NIGHTLY-DEVICE-ROUTINES.md).

## Results and Slack

The existing `#pr-builds` post is published when app/ASG producers finish; it
does not wait for a hardware test. Each requested routine adds requested
coverage, a request-pipeline link and, for a verified Mac archive, **View results**.
If no matching request can be found, the pipeline link opens the workflow page
without claiming a request exists. A label expresses requested coverage, not a pass.

The results link opens dev admin filtered to repository, PR number, full head
SHA, exact Mac archive SHA256, routine and platform. It shows **No results for
this build yet** until a matching export is uploaded. It never substitutes an
older candidate. Later test completion does not edit or republish the PR Slack post.

When a private worker finishes and retains its terminal receipt, the
[result callback](workflows/notify-release-routine.yml) posts a separate result
comment on the originating PR. It includes the customer test verdict, cleanup
and publication checks, exact head/base/build and artifact hashes, request and
worker attempts, and the recording/result link when uploaded. Setup failures
say **test not run**; older receipts without that verdict say **unknown**.
Results still post after the PR advances or merges and explicitly identify the
revision covered.

Each worker run/attempt/routine has its own comment, preserving failed and
successful reruns. Retrying the notification finds and reuses that exact
GitHub Actions comment; it neither reruns a device nor replaces another run's
history. If a send response is lost, rerun the result callback with the same
private run ID and attempt. A failure before any terminal receipt is retained
has no verified result to post; inspect its worker workflow instead.

The private worker uploads an immutable export with the original result and
recovery verdicts. Upload retries do not repeat device actions. See the public
[claim API](../cloud-v2/packages/core/TEST-RUN-CLAIMS.md) and
[results API](../cloud-v2/packages/core/TEST-RUNS.md). Core stores result metadata
in its configured database and evidence in its configured private artifact
storage; the admin viewer reads that same selected Core deployment. Localhost
records do not move to dev when code is merged.

## Source removal and existing runs

The private import includes the former public harness and its operational
specs/plans. Removing their public working-tree copies does not alter older Git
history, local recordings, firmware, or the frozen checkout used by an active
attempt. Existing attempts and recovery retain their original claims, journals,
source pins and ownership. A new private execution needs a separately qualified
configuration; a repository move does not clear a claim or mark a fixture ready.

The public [setup checks](workflows/e2e-setup-checks.yml) exercise the request,
dispatch, Slack links and shared installer. Harness, native recorder and firmware
adapter tests run in the private repository's hosted offline verification workflow.
