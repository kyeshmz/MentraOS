# Nightly device routine runbook

The [nightly workflow](workflows/nightly-device-routines.yml) targets five routines
on each latest verified coordinated **dev** and **staging** publication:

| Required routine | Platform | Current integration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `day1-ota` | iOS on Mac | Registered; needs qualified enrolled runtime and fixture |
| `mentra-call` | iOS on Mac | Registered; needs independent Call media/audio/network qualification |
| `account-miniapps` | iOS on Mac | Registered in source; runs its full definition on the selected Mac build, where unobserved Safari Google provider cases fail or block by name; not qualified |
| `connected-glasses` | Android | Registered in source; runs its full definition on the selected APK, where C8/C9 fail by name before input until their controllers exist; not qualified |
| `livestreamer` | iOS on Mac | Registered in source (managed WebRTC **Stream here** and local RTMP); preparation refuses before any claim until its real enrollment and native/Share URL observations exist; not qualified |

Planning, registration and qualification are separate steps. A planned target is
catalogued in [`device-routines.mjs`](scripts/device-routines.mjs) with its name,
label, platform and a `pending` reason. That wires its request choice, Slack row,
terminal filename and PR result rendering, but every execution path refuses it:
PR label and explicit requests, dispatch planning, the private callback and the
nightly send all require `registeredRoutine`. The planner lists it as unavailable
with its exact `pending` text and never requests it. Core lists it with a `planned`
reason that deployment enablement cannot override, and the private worker refuses
it during preparation before any claim. Registration is not a passing device result
either. No-glasses tests requested after each coordinated build remain unchanged
and stay the only successful-build defaults. The scheduler creates no commits or
builds.

`livestreamer` is registered in source: `worker/livestreamer.ts` exports
`prepareLivestreamerWorker`, which authenticates the request and binds its selected
Mac build for the managed Stream here and local RTMP flow with owned receiver and
network cleanup. Its runtime is still pending: an enrolled worker lane and fixture,
the recorded native state snapshots and an observed owned Stream here Share URL on
the selected build. Until those exist its preparation refuses before any claim, and
no run of it is qualified.

`connected-glasses` is registered in source: `worker/connected-glasses.ts` exports
`prepareConnectedGlassesWorker`, which authenticates dev and staging requests,
verifies the exact selected APK and OTA manifest, and runs the full definition in one
claimed lifecycle with claim-bound segmented recording, export and settlement. C14
follows the observed Wi-Fi path with its protected entry omitted between owned
recording segments. C8 and C9 have no controllers yet: their steps fail by name
before any input, and later unvisited steps stay not-run. C3's physical report
evidence, C8 route/reference/audio and C9 capture/sync remain unverified, so an
attempted run is honest but not qualification. Fixture access and other runtime
prerequisites stay the private worker's decisions.

`account-miniapps` is registered in source: `worker/account-miniapps.ts` exports
`prepareAccountMiniappsWorker`, which authenticates dev and staging requests, verifies
the exact selected Mac build and OTA manifest, and takes only the reviewed host of the
selected app backend, whose feedback reader, Core origin and account identity must be
that backend's. It runs the full definition in one claimed lifecycle with claim-bound
recording, export and settlement. The recorded original account and paired fixture,
the normal unpair, the customer account, SSO, pairing and miniapp sections and the
original return all belong to that private lifecycle. The owned Safari Google provider
completion, its Mentra callback and the selected provider window's close are
unqualified, and no real eligible customer completion has been observed: missing
observations yield failed or blocked results, so an attempted run is honest but not
qualification. Registration adds no qualification gate before a requested run.
Fixture access, credentials and other runtime prerequisites stay the private worker's
decisions.

Registering one is a single reviewed change: remove its `pending` (public) and
`planned` (Core), route its private enrolled configuration to the owner's completed
lifecycle instead of `worker/planned-routine-intake.ts`, and add its label to
`request-e2e-routine.yml`'s `pull_request` trigger and `REQUEST_ROUTINE` chain.

## Schedule and exact selection

Nightly starts at **04:00 America/Los_Angeles**. The 11:00 and 12:00 UTC triggers cover daylight
saving time; only the applicable trigger proceeds, including transition dates.
GitHub delivery can be delayed for at most six hours. Later delivery fails rather
than silently changing the night.

The schedule moved from 03:00 (10:00 and 11:00 UTC) and, before that, from midnight
(07:00 and 08:00 UTC). Only the 04:00 triggers plan or send; any other trigger is
refused, and an 11:00 UTC trigger in winter (03:00 Pacific) is a no-op. Sends from the
03:00 and midnight generations stay verifiable: each generation reads a sender's
creation time with its own intended Pacific hour, since 11:00 UTC was 03:00 in winter
but is 04:00 in summer, and all readings must name one local date. The date/channel/routine
send fence spans generations, so a member already sent on a local date by an earlier
generation is never sent again that date.

For each channel, inspect the latest 20 successful coordinated runs, newest first.
A candidate needs the successful immutable-publication step, its retained Actions
plan artifact, current channel ancestry and verified plan/receipt/archive/OTA
metadata. A green dry run is insufficient. Select the newest candidate with a
verified archive for at least one registered required platform, then **freeze that
publication for every routine on the channel**. Mac and Android selections must
share source commit, release identity, release-plan hash and OTA-manifest hash.

A missing platform stays unavailable on that selected publication; it does not
silently use an older build. A missing worker registration also stays unavailable,
with no substitute walkthrough. The separate availability job reports these gaps
while eligible members proceed. The summary names each routine, platform, release,
source run and publication attempt. It is a request summary, not a test verdict.

## Independent requests and resource ownership

Each matrix member calls **Request device routine** on trusted `dev`, with its
routine, exact source run/attempt and `request_origin: workflow-dispatch`. The
optional schema-2 marker is authenticated against the scheduled run and that
member's entered send step:

```json
{"sequence":{"kind":"nightly-routine","runId":123,"runAttempt":1,"member":"mentra-call"}}
```

The producer revalidates the selected publication and publishes immutable request
JSON. Its ordinary trusted callback queues the usual private `device-routine.yml`
job. The private worker independently verifies the request and enrolled runtime,
then uses the existing shared claim, app/device/audio leases, setup, cleanup,
verified return and result publisher. No extra queue or Mini polling daemon exists.

One routine's failed test verdict does not gate another. Call requires its own
fresh, manifest-compatible commissioned fixture and live preflight, including the
checks repeated under its lease. A failed Day1 run with a verified usable return
can therefore leave Call eligible; a retained/unknown fixture cannot. Independent
resources may run concurrently. Shared app, glasses, network or audio resources
must serialize through their existing ownership checks.

Each date/channel/routine has its own entered-send fence. Partial history, an
ambiguous response, a prior entered send or an attempt rerun refuses another send.
The generated request workflow must also remain attempt 1; rerunning it cannot
bypass this fence. A cancellation before the send step does not consume the member. Legacy whole-pair
sends fence both OTA and Call during migration. Other independent members remain
eligible. Never delete scheduler history or rerun it to repeat hardware actions;
reconcile the existing request/claim before a deliberate new request.

Already-published `nightly-ota-call` markers retain their original paired private
workflow and strict OTA prerequisite. They are not reinterpreted as independent
requests. New nightly requests use only the ordinary callback.

## Activation and results

`DEVICE_ROUTINE_NIGHTLY_ENABLED=true` activates the existing schedule. Run eligible
registered routines even while other routines are still being qualified. A missing
worker, artifact or usable fixture must remain visibly unavailable or failed;
it must not suppress unrelated routines or be reported as a passing test.

Before activation, confirm the trusted producer/callback, private enrolled runtime,
scoped GitHub App dispatch credentials and Core claim/upload capabilities. Routine
registration and fixture preconditions still apply. Enabling the schedule does not
waive them or certify a routine. Keep the default per-build no-glasses coverage.

Review the next applicable run's table for all ten targets (five on each channel).
Each member links to its request workflow and Admin recording/result. A request
success is not a device verdict; the result link appears when the worker publishes
it. An unavailable member is shown explicitly while eligible members proceed.
Verify integration on dev; do not create staging verification commits or manual
staging qualification runs. Normal scheduled staging coverage remains enabled.

Operator commands:

```bash
gh variable set DEVICE_ROUTINE_NIGHTLY_ENABLED --repo Mentra-Community/MentraOS --body true
# Stop future schedules without interrupting existing writes or cleanup:
gh variable set DEVICE_ROUTINE_NIGHTLY_ENABLED --repo Mentra-Community/MentraOS --body false
```

Public Actions retains request JSON and summaries. Private workers retain original
local evidence and upload immutable results/assets to the configured Core/admin
viewer. Every member has its own request, verdict and return state. Existing
`#dev-builds` and `#staging-builds` posts remain build notifications; their result
links do not imply nightly completion. Credentials, recordings and firmware bytes
remain outside this public source.

Focused offline checks:

```bash
node --test .github/scripts/nightly-device-routines.test.mjs \
  .github/scripts/request-e2e-routine.test.mjs \
  .github/scripts/coordinated-routine-request.test.mjs \
  .github/scripts/dispatch-device-routine.test.mjs \
  .github/scripts/notify-pr-builds.test.mjs \
  .github/scripts/pr-routine-result.test.mjs \
  .github/scripts/release-routine-slack.test.mjs
```

These synthetic metadata checks exercise no hardware and do not enable scheduling.
The five-by-two chain tests use a labelled model of a completed public registration
for the planned routines; a pass there models wiring only and qualifies nothing.
