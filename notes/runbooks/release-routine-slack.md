# Device results in release Slack posts

The existing dev/staging release post can replace its pending routine section
with the completed result and recording link. Downloads, release checks and OTA
targets stay in the same message. Release publication does not wait for testing.

## One-time configuration

| GitHub setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Environment `build-notifications` → secret `SLACK_BUILDS_BOT_TOKEN` | Slack bot token with `chat:write` |
| Repository variable `SLACK_DEV_BUILDS_CHANNEL_ID` | ID of `#dev-builds` |
| Repository variable `SLACK_STAGING_BUILDS_CHANNEL_ID` | ID of `#staging-builds` |

Create the environment in [MentraOS environment settings](https://github.com/Mentra-Community/MentraOS/settings/environments).
Store the token there; it does not need a repository-secret slot. Allow the
`dev` and `staging` branches. Leave required reviewers and wait timers off for
unattended notifications.

Three GitHub-hosted jobs select this environment: `coordinated-release.yml`'s
`notify-slack`, and `notify-release-routine.yml`'s `resolve` and `update`. The
resolver needs it because it checks token availability before producing work.
These are ordinary jobs, not `workflow_call` jobs: GitHub resolves the secret
from each job's environment, without passing it through `secrets: inherit`.
The sibling reusable build jobs do not receive this environment secret.
Existing repository webhook secrets and channel variables remain available.

Trigger behavior is unchanged: initial release posts run only on dev/staging
pushes; the result updater accepts manual/callback dispatch on `dev`. A manual
coordinated build does not post. Example and production notifications keep
their existing workflows and webhook configuration.

Invite that bot to both existing channels. The same bot must author and update
the post. Do not use the reports bot merely because its token already exists.
No Slack history permission is required. The token is used only by GitHub-hosted
notification jobs, never by the hardware worker.

Without this configuration, the existing incoming webhook still delivers the
release post and says **Terminal Slack updates unavailable; use the results
link**. Historical webhook posts have no retained editable receipt and are not
modified automatically.

## Flow

1. The release workflow posts with `chat.postMessage`, then retains
   `release-slack-message-RUN-ATTEMPT`: exact channel/message timestamp, bot,
   original blocks and verified build/archive identity.
2. The private worker retains a small `routine-terminal-RUN-ATTEMPT` artifact
   after execution, export, publication and settlement. It contains outcome
   flags and request identity, not device logs, account information or secrets.
3. A GitHub-hosted private completion callback uses the existing GitHub App to
   dispatch `notify-release-routine.yml` on trusted MentraOS `dev`. Inputs are
   private run ID/attempt selectors, never message text or a Slack destination.
4. The public workflow authenticates the private `main` attempt, the source
   request, published build and retained message. It edits that message with
   `chat.update`. Notification-only retries are separate from the original
   artifact publication attempt; the first matching editable post is retained.

`Passed` requires a passing test, teardown, return verification, ready fixture,
complete evidence, acknowledged settlement and successful result publication.
Uploading a result is different from passing it. Runs stopped before a terminal
receipt exists do not claim a Slack result; their workflow remains the diagnostic
source. PR requests use this same authenticated callback to post one comment
per worker run/attempt/routine on the originating PR; they do not need Slack
configuration. See [PR result history](../../.github/DEVICE-ROUTINES.md#results-and-slack).

One exception has no receipt by construction: a request cancelled while queued.
The private callback forwards a cancelled `device-routine.yml` attempt only when
its device job has explicitly empty runner fields and no steps. It accepts the
legacy single-job layout or exactly one successful Blacksmith `runner-preflight`
alongside `prepared-mac-routine`. The public resolver then re-proves it from
GitHub metadata:

- the exact private `main` attempt completed as cancelled with no terminal
  artifact; its device job completed as cancelled with explicitly empty runner
  fields and zero steps. In the two-job layout, the preflight and its availability
  check succeeded, both jobs match the run/attempt/revision, and the preflight has
  only the Blacksmith label. Any other layout or possible device execution is refused;
- private `main` makes GitHub derive the run name from the `request_run_id` and
  `request_attempt` inputs and the job labels from `routine_id`. These name the
  candidate request, which must be the trusted successful dev request with its
  authenticated artifact and pinned build/archive;
- the run was created by the dispatcher GitHub App's bot account (fixed numeric
  ID), and both the selected attempt and the run's latest metadata show that it
  is the first and only attempt. A rerun, even by the same App, may follow an
  attempt that executed without a receipt, so it is refused;
- the trusted dev `dispatch-device-routine.yml` callback for that exact request
  completed exactly one private send, and this is the only private run of that
  name created during the send.

Private dispatch does not return the created run ID, so historical runs have no
stronger binding than this. A same-input run created by another holder of the
App key during the send makes the history ambiguous and is refused. The only
unexcluded case is such a run appearing while the trusted send itself created
none. Even then the run did receive that request as input and never ran, so the
status stays true. Manual redispatches outside the send, and reruns, are refused.

The post then shows **Cancelled before execution; no test result** for that
routine. It is not a test result, result link, recording or qualification. It
only fills a pending row or replaces an older cancellation; any worker-attested
result for the routine outranks it. Build status and other routine rows are
unchanged. A started, interrupted or crashed attempt without a receipt is still
refused and keeps its recovery/evidence path. PR comments are unchanged.

To backfill one proven cancellation after this is deployed, dispatch this
workflow on `dev` with that worker run ID and attempt, exactly as the callback
does.

## Concurrent routines and retries

Updates to one post use GitHub's `concurrency.queue: max`, so a pending Call
update does not replace a pending OTA update. This has GitHub's 100-pending-job
limit; overflow/cancelled workflows must be rerun explicitly.

Each updater combines its result with the last retained full desired message.
It retains the combined state **before** calling Slack. The latest request
generation wins within a routine, while other routine rows are preserved.
Reapplying that complete message is safe after a failed or ambiguous
`chat.update`; it never creates a replacement post. Missing/expired state after
an earlier update is a visible notification error, not permission to erase old
results. Keep notification artifacts/history for the period that builds remain
testable. Initial `chat.postMessage` has no blind HTTP retry.

GitHub documents `queue: max`; local actionlint 1.7.12 has not yet added that
key. Validate all other rules while excluding only that exact unknown-key
diagnostic, and remove the exclusion when actionlint supports it.

Validate configuration with one new dev release and its no-glasses result.
Staging uses the identical path; no verification commits on staging are needed.
The sister private-worker change and bot setup must be present before terminal
updates can occur. A software test/PR approval is not live Slack verification.
