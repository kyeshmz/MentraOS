description: Create or extend a Mentra automated testing routine through AI-guided exploration, editable actions and assertions, deterministic replay and CI qualification. Use when adding test coverage or authoring routines in parallel. To request an existing routine on a PR, use select-pr-routines instead.

# Add a testing routine

**Author the routine in the private [Mentra-Automated-Testing repository](https://github.com/Mentra-Community/Mentra-Automated-Testing). Register its `routine:<id>` label in MentraOS so people and agents can request it on a PR.**

This skill is the entry point from MentraOS. Keep harness implementation, device
configuration and recordings in the private testing system.

## Authoring workflow

1. **Plan.** Define the human checks and expected outcomes in the brief below
   before choosing selectors or writing replay code.
2. **Explore and capture.** Use AI computer use to traverse the whole real flow
   in the Mentra App as a person would. Capture video, screenshots and action
   notes that show the actions and observed outcomes. When a real
   product bug appears, attempt an incident with the available evidence through
   the shared reporting path; retain its ID or submission failure. Keep the
   affected path failed or blocked and continue independent exploration whose
   prerequisites still hold. Bug fixing proceeds separately; it does not gate
   all discovery or turn the failed check into a pass. Acoustic calibration and
   probes are prerequisites for automated audio measurement, not for using or
   exploring the app: without them, keep audio assertions unverified and
   continue UI exploration that is otherwise valid. Permission, resource
   ownership, in-flight operation and recording/cleanup restrictions still apply.
3. **Encode the observed flow.** After a complete successful real traversal,
   turn its captured actions and outcomes into editable English steps and
   observable assertions using the existing flow helpers. Do not substitute
   scripted assumptions for paths that discovery has not completed successfully.
4. **Replay and qualify.** Replay the captured flow deterministically without
   AI for faster repeated coverage. Iterate from usable live state as
   described below, then qualify the complete flow with one clean recording
   against the exact source and build. Partial exploration remains development
   evidence, not a full routine pass.

## 1. Find the closest routine

Read the [routine catalog](../../../.github/scripts/device-routines.mjs). Follow
its revision-pinned definition and implementation links to understand existing
coverage. Extend an existing routine when the new behavior belongs in its flow;
create an ID when the behavior needs independent selection, resources or setup.

Work in a separate private-repository worktree. Use current `main` for new work
unless the task specifies another base; record that source revision. Catalog
links describe the published definition and may precede the current source.
If private access is missing, prepare the brief below and report that dependency;
do not recreate the private harness in MentraOS.

In the selected private revision, use `docs/ROUTINE-AUTHORING.md` and
`templates/routine-brief.md` when present. Read the closest working flow and
platform adapter before choosing commands. Authoring and development tools can
arrive separately from their documentation: verify the checkout's supported
entry point and help rather than assuming a command is implemented.

## 2. Define what a pass means

Write a short brief before selectors. Resolve choices from the request and
existing routines; ask only for missing product expectations that matter.

| Decision | Record |
| --- | --- |
| Identity | Routine ID, platform and user behavior it proves |
| Inputs | Exact selected PR/dev/staging build and its artifacts; OTA manifest when applicable |
| Resources | App, account, phone/glasses, browser, network or audio devices actually required |
| Starting state | Required app/account/pairing state and, for glasses routines, software versions |
| Return state | Usable state to leave behind, verified against this run's selected build |
| Steps | Stable ID, English action, expected result and observable assertion for each step |
| Evidence | Recording, screenshots, logs or device checks needed to substantiate the result |
| Limits | Prerequisites and behavior this routine does not exercise |

The next job establishes its own starting state. Teardown need not predict that
job's versions: reuse the selected build's return target, check the actual state,
and restore only what differs. A successful test may already satisfy it.

Declare the account needed, then use the platform's runtime account loader and
the worker recipe's account reference. Reuse its secret-input and report-redaction
helpers. Keep passwords out of routine definitions, prompts, request JSON and
evidence. Provision separate accounts for concurrent authenticated sessions.
Account files belong to host configuration, outside Git; credential rotation
must also refresh any pinned copy/reference used by that worker.

## 3. Reuse the lifecycle

When encoding deterministic replay, compose
**setup → test → final checks → cleanup → return verification** using
the existing platform lifecycle. Mac flows use the `Step` contract in
`tools/mentra-e2e/runner/suite.ts`; use the corresponding Android adapter for
Android execution. Reuse artifact preparation, fixture ownership, progress,
recording, incident submission and result publication.

- Put an observable outcome after each meaningful action. A click succeeding
  does not establish navigation, media delivery or a firmware update.
- Prefer existing stable selectors and state-based waits. Add a shared driver
  capability only when the routine cannot express its behavior with current ones.
- Preserve the original failed assertion when cleanup succeeds. Capture the
  failure and submit its incident through the shared path before cleanup loses
  useful app state. Route product defects to
  [fix-routine-failure](../fix-routine-failure/SKILL.md).
- Keep one owner for a shared harness defect. Other authors can continue their
  independent flows instead of adding per-routine workarounds.

## 4. Develop with recorded evidence

**Before the first complete pass, iterate from usable live state rather than
restarting the routine after every fix.** Preserve the failed observation and
retry the failed step or smallest dependent section. Do not repeat downloads,
installation, OTA preparation or an already-passed prefix merely because a later
step changed. Re-establish only prerequisites that changed or are no longer
proven. Keep the existing ownership and command-completion rules: an unanswered
writer needs reconciliation, and owned recorders still need confirmed cleanup.

For scripted iteration, run focused checks for the changed flow/helper and the
relevant typecheck, and use the supported development entry in the selected
private revision. For AI discovery, use the available authorized computer-use
surface; a replay entry is not a prerequisite. Preserve the exact harness
snapshot, selected app artifacts, steps, assertions, recording and cleanup
outcome with the result. Inspect playback and the failure evidence, not just
the process exit code.

Label section runs **development evidence**, recording their starting state,
executed steps and ending state. Do not combine successful sections into a full
pass. Once the flow works, perform one clean recorded end-to-end qualification
against the exact source and build. Normal CI and nightly runs retain their full
setup, assertions, teardown and verified return state.

Check the selected revision's actual commands. At private `e20dbb9` they are
the [`develop.ts` usage](https://github.com/Mentra-Community/Mentra-Automated-Testing/blob/e20dbb96b93696d681e7e06f5ddb90b580e86bfd/worker/develop.ts#L60-L90)
and the [development entry guide](https://github.com/Mentra-Community/Mentra-Automated-Testing/blob/e20dbb96b93696d681e7e06f5ddb90b580e86bfd/docs/DEVELOPMENT-ENTRY.md#development-segments);
copy invocations from there, not from memory.

- **Full `run`/`recover` (Mac unpaired only).** `run`, from private
  [PR #105](https://github.com/Mentra-Community/Mentra-Automated-Testing/pull/105),
  wraps the frozen flow in install, account setup and Home cleanup. `recover`
  reconciles that original execution; it is not a failed-step retry.
- **`segment` (`mac-unpaired-ui` and `android-no-glasses` only).** It runs one
  authored `--section`, or a stable `--from`/`--through` step range, once with
  `--mode execute` (sends actions) or `--mode observe` (no input; recheck a
  corrected assertion after an answered action). The snapshot and flow export
  are hash-pinned. A first segment names a platform-specific settled `--origin`;
  each later one names the previous immutable result with `--parent`.
  Before any input it requires the pinned previous owner settled (writer and
  recorder included), the actual pinned app and driver/tools, and fresh entry
  assertions. It never installs, signs in or runs setup: if the app moved or
  needs setup it is refused, so use full `run` or the existing setup instead.
  Each segment has its own recording and result; a failed result is kept and
  never rewritten by a later success.
- `inspect-segment` verifies a result receipt without device access.
  `recover-segment` reconciles the same original owner and never resends
  unknown input or recorder work. `end` closes the session with the declared
  return cleanup.

Segments are local UI development evidence, not Day1 firmware or Call
continuation. Merged source does not mean a host's runtime is ready or
authorized to run them, and the private guide records only offline tests; no
live segment or full routine pass is implied. Missing scripted replay, segment
or observer support does not itself stop authorized AI computer-use discovery
on available resources. State the automation gap, continue the real flow and
retain video, screenshots and action notes; leave assertions unverified when
their required evidence is unavailable. Do not invent flags or present a
full-lifecycle rerun as continuation.

Separate worktrees allow parallel authoring; execution still uses shared resource
ownership. Independent Mac and Android fixtures can run together. Routines using
the same app, glasses, account or network/audio configuration must coordinate.
Use the existing ownership/admission and cleanup rules for the resource; do not
clear another run's lock, change global enrollment or invoke a legacy runner to
bypass an unavailable development entry. If a resource is owned or an operation
remains in flight, wait for its normal handoff or reconciliation; continue
independent discovery on available resources or source work while that dependency
is resolved.

Local development proves the tested snapshot. It is not a CI qualification of a
different revision or platform.

## 5. Register, review and qualify

1. Open the private routine PR with the brief, focused validation and recorded
   development result. Run the [Codex PR review skill](../codex-pr-review/SKILL.md)
   for PRs created or updated and address its findings.
2. Trace the closest routine through the private worker's supported IDs/dispatch
   and MentraOS request/Admin selection. Add the new ID wherever required. In
   [device-routines.mjs](../../../.github/scripts/device-routines.mjs), provide
   coverage, platform, prerequisites, exclusions and links pinned to the reviewed
   private implementation. Coordinate the private worker rollout before public
   requests can reach the new ID; a label alone cannot make it executable.
3. Ensure the exact `routine:<id>` label exists in MentraOS. Catalog registration
   does not create it. Check with `gh label list --repo Mentra-Community/MentraOS
   --search 'routine:gallery'`; inspect the exact name. Only if absent, create it:

   ```bash
   gh label create routine:gallery --repo Mentra-Community/MentraOS \
     --color 0E8A16 --description 'Request the registered gallery routine'
   ```

   Substitute the actual registered ID. Preserve existing labels and their
   settings; do not use `--force` to overwrite them.
4. Once registered and admitted by the worker, request the routine against an
   exact existing build. Use [select-pr-routines](../select-pr-routines/SKILL.md)
   to append its label to a relevant PR, or use Admin for a selected PR/dev/staging
   artifact. For example, after `gallery` is registered:

   ```bash
   gh pr edit PR --repo Mentra-Community/MentraOS --add-label routine:gallery
   ```

5. Check the resulting run: tested build and harness revision, assertions,
   recordings, duration, failure/incident details and verified return state.
   Report pending or failed qualification explicitly. Registration does not
   automatically opt the routine into dev/staging defaults or nightly schedules;
   change those only when included in the task and after qualification.

Finish with the routine ID/label, covered behavior, implementation PRs and exact
qualification result or remaining gap. Public PRs should link approved result
pages; keep credentials, private logs and raw recordings out of their bodies.
