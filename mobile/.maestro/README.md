# MentraOS Maestro Tests

This directory contains Maestro E2E tests for the MentraOS mobile app.

## Prerequisites

1. Install Maestro:

```bash
curl -Ls "https://get.maestro.mobile.dev" | bash
```

2. Ensure you have a device/emulator running with the MentraOS app installed

## Running Tests

### Run all tests:

```bash
npm run test:maestro
```

### Run specific test:

```bash
maestro test .maestro/flows/01-auth-flow.yaml
```

### Run tests in CI mode:

```bash
npm run test:maestro:ci
```

## Test Structure

### Core UI Tests (No Hardware Required)

- `01-auth-flow.yaml` - Login/logout functionality
- `02-tab-navigation.yaml` - Bottom tab navigation
- `03-app-store.yaml` - Browse and install apps from store
- `05-no-internet-connection.yaml` - Offline error handling

### Simulated Hardware Tests

- `04c-pairing-without-microphone.yaml` - iOS and Android discovery with microphone access denied (signed in, no glasses paired)
- `04b-mentra-live-adaptive-scan.yaml` - Direct Mentra Live scan, timeout help, and in-place retry
- `04-simulated-glasses-pairing.yaml` - Pairing flow with simulated glasses (built-in feature)
- `06-launch-app-simulated-glasses.yaml` - Launch Mira app on simulated glasses

### Helper Flows

- `helpers/login-helper.yaml` - Reusable login flow

## Environment Variables

- `MAESTRO_APP_ID` - App bundle ID (default: com.mentra.mentra)

## Writing New Tests

1. Create new `.yaml` file in `flows/` directory
2. Follow naming convention: `XX-test-name.yaml`
3. Add to `config.yaml` if needed
4. Use element IDs where possible for reliability
5. Use regex patterns for text that might vary

## Tips

- Use `takeScreenshot` to debug test failures
- Use `optional: true` for elements that might not always appear
- Use `runFlow` with `when` conditions for conditional logic
- Check `helpers/` for reusable flow components

## Troubleshooting

### Tests failing to find elements?

- Run with `maestro studio` for interactive debugging
- Check if element IDs are properly set in the app
- Verify text matches exactly (case-sensitive)

### Simulated features not working?

- Ensure simulated glasses option is available in the glasses pairing flow
- Check that the app can detect and connect to simulated devices

### Network tests failing?

- Some emulators don't properly support airplane mode toggle
- May need to manually test network scenarios

## Microphone denial regression

Run `maestro test -e MAESTRO_APP_ID=com.mentra.mentra .maestro/flows/04c-pairing-without-microphone.yaml`
on a signed-in iOS simulator or Android emulator starting at Home with no glasses paired. This sets
microphone access to denied and verifies that Mentra Live discovery opens.

Before resubmitting to Apple, verify on iPhone, iPad, and Android with the updated native build:

1. With microphone access undetermined, pair Mentra Live and simulated glasses.
   Neither pairing flow should request microphone access. Repeat with access denied.
2. With simulated glasses, launch a miniapp requiring microphone access (for example,
   Captions). Decline the system prompt. The miniapp must remain closed, Home must
   stay usable, and Settings must not open or be suggested immediately afterward.
3. On Android, also exercise repeated denial and "Don’t ask again"; neither should
   immediately suggest Settings. Try that miniapp again after access is blocked. Cancel the feature-specific Settings explanation and
   verify Home remains usable. Repeat and explicitly select Open Settings to verify
   that this is the only action that opens Settings.
4. Grant access and retry the miniapp; verify transcription starts. A miniapp without
   microphone requirements must still open when access is denied.
5. Open the fullscreen mirror without microphone access. Only attempting video
   recording should request access. Declining must leave the mirror usable.
